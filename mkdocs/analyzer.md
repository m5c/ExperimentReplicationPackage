# Submission Analyzer

We wrote an open source tool to test migrated applications:  
[Analyzer Sources and Documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/m5c/RestifyAnalyzer)

## How it works

 * You download the raw participant submission data from this webpage
 * You clone the analyzer and run it. It produces a CSV test report.
 * You compare the test report against the one we use for our own statistical analysis, so you see out statistical analysis actually operates on the real data.
