# Objects

The study contains three sample legacy applications for migration to REST. One application (The Zoo) was used for illustrative purposes, the other two (The BookStore, Xox) served as study objects, i.e. participants were working with these two applications.  
We release the source code and build / run instructions for all three legacy java applications.

## The Zoo

The zoo is **only** used for subject training. It is smaller than the applications used for the migration tasks.
