# Training and Task Material

The original task training and task instructions material. One for each of the four experiment groups:

 * [Red Group](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~mschie3/red/restify-study/)
 * [Green Group](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~mschie3/green/restify-study/)
 * [Blue Group](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~mschie3/blue/restify-study/)
 * [Yellow Group](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~mschie3/yellow/restify-study/)

 All websites were generated from a MkDocs markdown template. The [sources are accessible, here](https://github.com/m5c/RestifyParticipantInstructions).

 > Task context and order changes, depending on which group a participant was allocated to.
